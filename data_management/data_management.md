# DRAFT - Data standards and data management






# NOTES
# PacMAN data management

Goal of the PacMAN data management: develop a transparent and reproducible workflow for feeding observation data into risk assessments to inform monitoring and risk management.

## Principles of data management

### Open Science Framework

See research lifecycle graphic

### Why data sharing

Wealth of data has been collected, but often scattered and inaccessible (different formats and standards).

Data from natural history collections, surveys and monitoring programs, citizen science, literature, machine collected data, sequence based data.

Use for conservation and spatial planning, climate change research, human health and food security (see use cases and library). Reference to PacMAN.

EBVs, see slide.

Identifying knowledge gaps.

Incentive for scientists to better manage their data and ensure high quality.

Visibility for researchers and donors.

Share resources, avoid repetition.

Meta-analyses for discovering trends.

Better transparency, reproducibility, decision making.

Required by funding agencies or journals.

Converting to open data is an investment, so the key is to practice open science by design.

Creating new opportunities for collaboration.

Literature biased towards successful studies / expected results (from Open Science Framework) -> if open, can help other researchers.

New potential collaborations.

### Best practices

- documentation (metadata)
- data storage: easy access, archival, long term formats
- discovery
